<h1>Third-Party Insurance</h1>
<p>Third-party insurance is essentially a form of liability insurance purchased by an insured (first party)
  from an insurer (second party) for protection against the claims of another (third party). The first
  party is responsible for their damages or losses, regardless of the cause of those damages.
  There are two types of automobile third-party liability coverage. First, bodily injury liability covers
  costs resulting from injuries to a person. These injuries' costs could include expenses like hospital
  care, lost wages, and pain and suffering due to the accident. Second, property damage liability covers
  costs resulting from damages to or loss of property. Examples of property damage include the payment to
  replace landscaping and mailboxes, as well as compensation for loss of use of a structure.

<h1>What is Third Party Liability Coverage</h1>
<p>Third party liability coverage is a part of the insurance policy that addresses issues when, you as a driver,
  either damage somebody’s property or cause somebody’s injuries or death and have to deal with legal
  responsibility. Third party liability coverage is mandatory in Canada and its minimum is $200,000. You are not
  allowed to operate a vehicle without this insurance coverage.
</p>
<h1> Third Party Liability Coverage: Recommendation</h1>
<p>Though it appears like a significant amount, it is highly recommended to increase this limit up to $1,000,000 or
  $2,000,000. Legal costs and consequences of an accident on the road can be devastating and so can the associated
  expenses.It is also important to know that this part of the policy does not cover damages to your vehicle.

<h3> How does car third party insurance work?</h3>
In order to better understand the concept of third party insurance, let us look at some terminologies.
  <ul>For example, in the event of a car accident, the parties involved are as follows:
    <li>First party: The insured person or policy holder</li>
    <li>Second party: The insurance company </li>
    <li>Third party: The person who claims for the damages caused by the first party</li>

</ul>
<p>In an event where an insured person with a third party insurance policy is held legally liable for injuries or damage
done to a third party, then his/her insurance company indemnifies the insured person.<br/>

<b>With a Reliance general third party only car insurance policy, you will get the following benefits:</b>.<br/>
Cover for causing accidental injury or death to the third party
Cover for accidental damage to the third party's property
In the event of a car accident, an insured person with a third party insurance policy is required to immediately inform
the insurance company of the incident. If you were responsible for the accident (or the other driver believes you were
responsible), it's almost certain that a claim will be made against you, which your insurance company will be expected
to pay. So, it is of utmost importance that your insurance provider is aware about any accident you are involved in.
